1# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you make a repository, file .git is created, but 1st commit is not made. You need this repository to make commits in the future. 
2# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? 
It is just a temporary area where you can store files. It helps when you want to commit just some files in your repository.
