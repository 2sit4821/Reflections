1# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you make a repository, file .git is created, but 1st commit is not made. You need this repository to make commits in the future. 
2# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? 
It is just a temporary area where you can store files. It helps when you want to commit just some files in your repository. 
3# How can you use the staging area to make sure you have ine commit per logical change?
I can use diff --stag to make sure that there is only one logical change to commit. If I changed a few files, thanks to staging area I can commit them separately. 
4# What are the situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches help to keep everything organized or test some new fetures or add something that shouldn't refer to the whole program, rather be a optional feature like language or difficulty mode.
